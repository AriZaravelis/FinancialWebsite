# FinancialWebsite

This is a project I completed for my Web Programming class. The website is designed for the average person that is interested in viewing the most important details in a company's financial statements. Specifically, it allows users to access the financial statements from the top rated companies on the Fortune500 list in 2021. Information such as Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements will be available to be viewed. This information is useful because it can potentially give users a better understanding of a company's financials which can influence investment decisions. It was also my hope for this website to serve as an archive for historical financial statements of some of the biggest companies in the world. Note that this website can only be accessed locally since it interacts with my local database.
